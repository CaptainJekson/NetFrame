Simple networking framework for Unity games

## üìñ How To Install

### Unity Engine

Using package manager by URL:
https://github.com/CaptainJekson/NetFrame.git?path=/Packages/com.jeskvo.net-frame

### .Net Platform

Using nuget package:
https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetFrame

## üìñ Starting

### Server

```c#
_server = new NetFrameServer(2000);
_server.Start(8080, 10);
```
To start the server, create an instance of the server, 
passing the maximum packet size, and call the `Start()` 
method, passing the port number and maximum number of connected clients.


```c#
private void Update()
{
    _server.Run(100);
}
```

Also, it is necessary to call the `Run()` method every frame 
for Unity or in an infinite loop for .NET to maintain the session 
and check for available packets to read. You can set a cooldown to control how often this 
method is called in order to avoid calling it too frequently. 
Use the limit parameter to avoid deadlocks.

```c#
_server.ClientConnection += OnClientConnection;
_server.ClientDisconnect += OnClientDisconnect;
```
The `ClientConnection` and `ClientDisconnect` events 
are triggered when a client connects and disconnects, respectively.

```c#
_server.LogCall += OnLog;
```

The `LogCall` event is triggered to display server logs, warnings, and errors.

```c#
_server.Stop();
```

Call `Stop` to stop the server. 
For example, in the OnApplicationQuit() method in Unity.

### Client

```c#
_client = new NetFrameClient();
_client.Connect("127.0.0.1", 8080);
```

To connect a client to the server, create an instance of the 
server and call the `Connect()` method, passing the 
IP address and port number as parameters.

```c#
private void Update()
{
    _server.Run(100);
}
```

Similarly to the server, you need to call the Run() method 
every frame for Unity or in an infinite loop for .NET to maintain the session.

```c#
_client.ConnectionSuccessful += OnConnectionSuccessful;
_client.Disconnected += OnDisconnected;
_client.LogCall += OnLog;
```

The `ConnectionSuccessful` event is triggered when a connection to the server 
is successful. `Disconnected` is triggered when the client disconnects, 
for example, if the `Disconnect()` method is called manually.
`LogCall` is used to display logs, similar to the server.


## üìñ Dataframes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Initialize ‚ö†Ô∏è

It is necessary to initialize the packets at the start of the application 
to create a collection of them. Specify the current project assembly 
in which the dataframes will be created.

```c#
NetFrameDataframeCollection.Initialize(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
```
### Sending

To create a packet (called dataframes in NetFrame), you need to create a 
structure that implements the `INetworkDataframe` interface. For example:

```c#
public struct TestDataframe : INetworkDataframe
{
    public string Name;
    public byte Age;

    public void Write(NetFrameWriter writer)
    {
        writer.WriteString(Name);
        writer.WriteByte(Age);
    }


    public void Read(NetFrameReader reader)
    {
        Name = reader.ReadString();
        Age = reader.ReadByte();
    }
}
```

Dataframes for reading and writing support all standard C# types. 
To send a data frame from the client to the server, create an instance 
of the data frame and call the `_client.Send()` method.

```c#
var testDataframe = new TestDataframe
{
    Name = "Kate",
    Age = 25,
};
_client.Send(ref testDataframe);
```

On the server, you should call the `_server.Send()` method to send 
to a specific client with a specific identifier or send to all 
clients simultaneously using `_server.SendAll()`. You can also use
`SendAllExcept()` to send to all clients except one.

```c#
var testDataframe = new TestDataframe
{
    Name = "Kate",
    Age = 25,
};
_server.Send(ref testDataframe, 1); //send to client with id = 1
_server.SendAll(ref testDataframe); //send to all clients
```

### Listen

To subscribe or unsubscribe to the event of receiving a packet on the client 
and server, you need to use the `Subscribe` and `Unsubscribe` methods, 
respectively.

```c#
_client.Subscribe<TestDataframe>(TestDataframeHandler);

_client.Unsubscribe<TestDataframe>(TestDataframeHandler);
```

You also need to define a handler method for this event. For example:

```c#
private void TestDataframeHandler(TestDataframe dataframe)
{
    Debug.Log($"Name: {dataframe.Name} Age: {dataframe.Age}");
}
```

On the server, it is the same, except that the client's Id will be passed 
to the handler method:

```c#
private void TestDataframeHandler(TestDataframe dataframe, int id)
{
    Debug.Log($"Client id: {id} Name: {dataframe.Name} Age:     {dataframe.Age}");
}
```

## üìñ Sending a collection in a dataframe

First, create a structure that will be an element of the collection. 
Implement the `IWriteable` and `IReadable` interfaces.

```c#
public struct UserNetworkModel : IWriteable, IReadable
{
    public string Name;
    public uint Age;

    public void Write(NetFrameWriter writer)
    {
        writer.WriteString(Name);
        writer.WriteUInt(Age);
    }


    public void Read(NetFrameReader reader)
    {
        Name = reader.ReadString();
        Age = reader.ReadUInt();
    }
}
```

Next, define a dataframe with the collection, for example, a `List` type, 
as follows:

```c#
public struct UsersDataframe : INetworkDataframe
{
    public List<UserNetworkModel> Users;

    public void Write(NetFrameWriter writer)
    {
        writer.WriteInt(Users?.Count ?? 0);

       if (Users != null)
       {
           foreach (var user in Users)
           {
               writer.Write(user);
           }
       }
    }


    public void Read(NetFrameReader reader)
    {
        var count = reader.ReadInt();

       if (count > 0)
       {
           Users = new List<UserNetworkModel>();
           for (var i = 0; i < count; i++)
           {
               Users.Add(reader.Read<UserNetworkModel>());
           }
       }
    }
}
```

Using the same analogy, you can implement data frames with collections of
`Dictionary` and other types.
